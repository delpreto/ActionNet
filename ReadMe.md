# ActionNet - Badminton Stroke Data Collection

For dataset, you can refer to the site: XXX

While badminton performance relies heavily on the success of each stroke, there exists a notable scarcity of comprehensive badminton action dataset available for analysis and training feedback. This paper introduces a novel badminton action dataset, which provides a comprehensive and accurate collection of both biomechanical and physiological data for two fundamental strokes in badminton - the overhead clear and the backhand drive. The dataset includes 7,772 stroke instances from 25 participants in total, each of which comprising multiple wearable sensor data including eye tracking, body tracking, electromyography, and insole pressure. Moreover, the dataset is annotated in terms of stroke type, expert level, hitting sound, ball landing position, and hitting position. Our data were collected from twelve beginners, eight intermediates, and five experts, allowing for a diverse range of skill levels to be represented. The dataset provides a valuable resource to understand the biomechanics of fundamental badminton strokes and to develop computer-assisted tools for action analysis and training feedback. Its potential usefulness is validated by out proof-of-concept models to classify the stroke actions and expertise levels.
